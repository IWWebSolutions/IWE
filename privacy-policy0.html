                                <br>
                                Additionally, personal information may be shared when deemed necessary for the maintenance, upgrading, servicing, or

                                <br>
                                If a user chooses to delete or deactivate their account, they will lose access to all services offered by India World

                            <strong>Information Protection</strong>
                            <p>At no point does India World Exports engage in the sale of user data—whether in bulk or otherwise—to any third party, 
                                especially where it might be misused for telemarketing, telesales, or email marketing activities. India World Exports 
                                also does not sell any user's personal or business information unless explicitly permitted by the user.
                                <br>
                                Any statistical data shared with advertisers, partners, or sponsors is strictly aggregated information about user 
                                preferences and trends, ensuring no personally identifiable information is disclosed.
                                <br>
                                Users are advised to:
                                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Safeguard their account details.
                                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Log out of their profiles after use.
                                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Share information only after verifying the recipient’s intent.
                                <br>
                                These measures are especially crucial if users share devices with others or access their accounts from public computers.
                                <br>
                                India World Exports takes commercially viable and necessary steps to ensure the secure treatment of user information. 
                                However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While India World Exports strives to 
                                protect users' personal and business information, users acknowledge that transmitting data to the platform is done at their 
                                own risk.
                                <br>
                                Once the information is received, India World Exports makes every effort to secure it within its systems. However, users 
                                posting personal and business information online in public areas may receive unsolicited messages from third parties, as 
                                these details become accessible to others.

                                While the app is designed to deliver a seamless experience, some services or features available on the India World Exports 
                                website may not be incorporated into the app due to its compact design. Users agree that such differences are inherent to 
                                mobile applications, and no requests to include these features in the app will be entertained.
