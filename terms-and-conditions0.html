                                services, hereby agree to be bound by and comply with all the rules, regulations, laws, orders, and notifications issued by the Government of 
                                India and its agencies at all times. As an intermediary under Section 2(1)(w) of the IT Act 2000, India World Exports is only offering a 
                                platform to the suppliers for showcasing their products and services and has no liability related to the content, images, information, or any 
                                such details related to chemicals, drugs, or medicines. Suppliers selling prescriptive medicines and/or drugs hereby undertake that they shall 
                                solely be responsible and bear all the liabilities concerning the sale/purchase in light of the Schedules of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, 
                                including its amendments. The suppliers also agree that they have complete authorization/ownership/dealership/selling rights and take full 
                                responsibility to ensure there is no violation of any nature. The site does not represent the seller nor the buyer in specific transactions and 
                                is merely an advertising platform, having no part in the transactions between buyers and sellers. The site neither controls nor can be held 
                                liable or responsible for the quality, safety, lawfulness, or availability of the products or services offered for sale on the site or the 
                                ability of the suppliers to complete a sale or the ability of buyers to complete a purchase.
                                The user agrees to indemnify and save India World Exports, its affiliates, directors, officers, and employees harmless from any liability or 
                                losses arising due to any illegal sale/purchase of drugs and/or medicines. Users will not post any information related to medicines, drugs, or 
                                chemicals mentioned in Schedule X of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, including its amendments. In case India World Exports receives any 
                                complaint, directive, or mandate against any content/listing, the site reserves the right to remove the same without prior notification. This 
                                may include the suspension of membership if found to be derogatory to the prevailing Indian laws.
